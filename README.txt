food
====
This project is analysis of spending patterns on food in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The file main.py contains all the code 
that was used in the analysis while the file Food_Analysis.pdf contains the results of the analysis along with an interepretation
of some of the results. 

Please note that this is a project I undertook purely for the sake of my interest.
